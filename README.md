# Claims Processing Optimization (Excel Interactive Dashboard)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to identify delays and improve claims resolution times across different types of insurance claims. By analyzing data on claim type, resolution time, adjuster performance, location, and automation levels, we aim to uncover inefficiencies, measure adjuster productivity, and provide actionable insights. The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard designed for insurance managers to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.
