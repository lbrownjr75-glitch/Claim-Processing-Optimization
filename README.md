# Claims Processing Optimization (Excel Interactive Dashboard)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to identify delays and improve claims resolution times across different types of insurance claims. By analyzing data on claim type, resolution time, adjuster performance, location, and automation levels, we aim to uncover inefficiencies, measure adjuster productivity, and provide actionable insights. The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard designed for insurance managers to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.
## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/lbrownjr75-glitch/Claim-Processing-Optimization/blob/main/claims_processing_dataset1.0.xlsx">dataset</a>
## Key Business Questions (Driven by KPIs)
-	Which claim types have the longest average time to resolve?
-	How does the average resolution time vary by adjuster and location?
-	Does automation level impact the speed of claim resolution?
-	Which locations are processing the highest volume of claims?
-	How does claim complexity affect processing time and claim status outcomes?
## Creation Process
-	Imported claims_processing_dataset.xlsx into Excel.
-	Reviewed and cleaned data (checked for blanks, formatted date fields). 
-	Created calculated fields:
o	Time to Resolve (days) if not present.
o	Complexity Level (Low, Medium, High). 
o	Month Reported for trend analysis.
-	Merged all pivot tables into a single dashboard with a slicer for dynamic interaction.
