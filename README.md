# Claims Processing Optimization (Excel Interactive Dashboard)
This dashboard will allow you to consolidates key claims data into an interactive visual tool, empowering insurance managers to monitor performance, spot trends, and drive operational improvements. It showcases the value of automation, identifies process bottlenecks, and highlights standout adjusters, serving as both a strategic decision aid and a strong portfolio piece for analytics professionals.
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to identify delays and improve claims resolution times across different types of insurance claims. By analyzing data on claim type, resolution time, adjuster performance, location, and automation levels, we aim to uncover inefficiencies, measure adjuster productivity, and provide actionable insights. The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard designed for insurance managers to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.
## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/lbrownjr75-glitch/Claim-Processing-Optimization/blob/main/claims_processing_dataset1.0.xlsx">dataset</a>
## Key Business Questions (Driven by KPIs)
-	Which claim types have the longest average time to resolve?
-	How does the average resolution time vary by adjuster and location?
-	Does automation level impact the speed of claim resolution?
-	Which locations are processing the highest volume of claims?
-	How does claim complexity affect processing time and claim status outcomes?
## Creation Process
-	Imported claims_processing_dataset.xlsx into Excel.
-	Reviewed and cleaned data (checked for blanks, formatted date fields). 
-	Created calculated fields:
o	Time to Resolve (days) if not present.
o	Complexity Level (Low, Medium, High). 
o	Month Reported for trend analysis.
-	Merged all pivot tables into a single dashboard with a slicer for dynamic interaction.

## Project Insights
-	Auto and Property claims had the longest average resolution times, especially in lower-automated regions.
-	Adjusters in California had the best performance, with the lowest average time to resolve and highest closure rate.
-	High automation levels were associated with faster processing times, suggesting a clear case for expanding automation tools.
-	Claims with higher complexity scores (8–10) had 2–3x longer resolution times, indicating a need for specialized adjusters or escalation workflows.
## Executive Summary
The Claims Processing Optimization Dashboard provides an actionable visual summary of insurance claim workflows and operational performance. Using real-world data, the dashboard highlights key trends in claim resolution time, adjuster efficiency, and the impact of automation and complexity. The insights reveal significant performance gaps across locations and adjusters, and show that higher automation leads to faster resolution.
This dashboard is designed for insurance operations managers to monitor and improve claims processing by:
-	Quickly identifying bottlenecks
-	Recognizing top-performing adjusters
-	Justifying resource allocation for automation
-	Enhancing service delivery through data-backed decisions
This project demonstrates strong data analysis skills, dashboard design, and storytelling for stakeholders, making it an excellent addition to a data analyst or business intelligence portfolio.
